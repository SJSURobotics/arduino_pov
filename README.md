This is the code for a POV display built by the SJSU Robotics Club.

The POV is based on an arduino with a strip of seven LEDs on each side of the POV display.

Both sides of the display show the same message.

The initial hardware design consisted of a computer case fan with a rotating attachment that held the LEDs, battery pack, and the arduino.

The arduino has sufficient pins to drive both sides of the display independently, which should probably be considered in revision 2 of the hardware.
